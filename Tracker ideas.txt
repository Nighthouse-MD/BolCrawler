TODO:
- split up db's
    -> one for snapshots only
    -> one for productsToTrack and dailyParses

- refactor stats api: one object per ean with collections of stat rows: per day, per week, per month, total

- improve crawler: put all seller products for one ean in basket, go to basket, do 999 trick on all items -> this does the trick for all sellers of a product in 2 requests

- track seller api, get all products of one seller and add them to productsToTrack

- stats api: get all product stats for one seller and add them to productsToTrack

- use monitoror as monitor instead of app insights
