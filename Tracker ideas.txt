TODO:
- split up db's
    -> one for snapshots only
    -> one for productsToTrack and dailyParses

- refactor stats api: one object per ean with collections of stat rows: per day, per week, per month, total

- NL/BE strategy

DONE - improve crawler: put all seller products for one ean in basket, go to basket, do 999 trick on all items -> this does the trick for all sellers of a product in 2 requests

- track seller api, get all products of one seller and add them to productsToTrack

- stats api: get all product stats for one seller and add them to productsToTrack

- use monitoror as monitor instead of app insights

- round revenue to 2 decimals in api

- add currentprice to dailyParse, even if no sales

- detect when there is a big price jump for one seller, then look at all other sellers, if they are out of stock there is a clear competitive market for a highly looked after product

- when the ALL SELLERS average price goes down gradually, there might be a trend that the market for this product is becoming saturated

DONE - add apiuser table: id, name, date, application

- cache stats, cache productsToTrack

- add totalUntilNow stat record per item per seller

- add amountOfSnapshots per calculated stat record

DONE - fix price above 1000 punctuation issue

- PRICING!!

PARTIALLY DONE - group db snapshot write calls per product

- inactivate items to track when REASONS: always 500 items, always 0 items,...
